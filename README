~ Hovering Animation with Light Effect ~

This was done in 2 parts :
1) Creating the "items" (options) for both mobile and desktop, making sure the banner-images were implemented in the correct way.
2) Creating the hovering animation with the diffused flashlight effect.



Remark:
I should've started first with the animation (making sure it works flawlesly and correctly). Having it done in reverse, I realized the importance of order and planning ahead (need to work more on this).



Things which I have learned in this small project :
- The usefulness of pseudo-elements (::after + ::before), how they can be used for different kinds of styling.
- How to get the position of my cursor (using mouse events).
- The getBoundingClientRect() API which can be used to calculate the distance of a HTML element relative to the (0,0) of the HTML doc.
- Arrow functions and how they work in an event-context.


There are 2 components for our animation :
- The main light (a div with a white-ish radial gradient background)
- The border light (a div with a bright-white radial gradient background)


Creating the hovering animation:
- Define a "fake border" which is actually a div with a grey background and with the z-index:0.
- Define a content box which will hold our content. It will have z-index:2.
- Create a pseudo-element for the fake-border (with a radial gradient background) which will be the main light. This element will afect both the content and the border . z-index:3.
- Create a pseudo-element for the fake-border ( with a bright radial gradient) which will only apply to the border and which will lighten it up.z-index:1.
- Using js we make the pseudo-elements move with our cursor.


Things for the future :
- To try and recreate more designs ( preferably with as less help as as possible )
